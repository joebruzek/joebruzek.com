My personal Website


This version of the website was built using Angularjs, mostly because that was the entirety of my web experience at the time I started building it. Version 2 will be implemented outside of angular as a purely static site.

**June 14, 2015**

This website is officially outdated and will be replaced by the redesign happening over in my joebruzek.github.io repo.
